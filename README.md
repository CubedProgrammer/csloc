# Source lines of code counter for Windows
Counts lines of code recursively in a directory, only works on windows so far, it cannot be configured to count a file, only directories. Also it will not count lines that are empty or only have spaces.

On windows? You're in luck! Prebuilt executable should be in releases, if I remember, but that is a big if.
On ubuntu? You're in luck! Prebuilt executable is in releases.
